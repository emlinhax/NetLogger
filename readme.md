This project allows you to capture literally ALL activity happening in the System.Net class\n
You can capture activity of your own assembly or even let it load an external assembly. (Assembly.Load)

The logfile that results from this will contain EVERYTHING you could ever need.


Usage: Drag another .net assembly onto SystemLoggingTrick.exe and watch it fill up the logfile.
